The Optimal Stopping Problem
============================

The modern formulation of the optimal stopping problem with finite horizon and non disconting factor goes as follows

where *T*‚ÄÑ&gt;‚ÄÑ0 is called the horizont, *t*‚ÄÑ‚àà‚ÄÑ\[0,‚ÄÜ*T*\], and *x*‚ÄÑ‚àà‚ÄÑ*E* (generally *E*‚ÄÑ=‚ÄÑ‚Ñù or *E*‚ÄÑ=‚ÄÑ‚Ñù<sub>+</sub>); (*X*<sub>*s*</sub>)<sub>*s*‚ÄÑ=‚ÄÑ0</sub><sup>*T*</sup> is an stochastic process with space state *E*; the supreme above is taken among all the stopping times of (*X*<sub>*s*</sub>)<sub>*s*‚ÄÑ=‚ÄÑ*t*</sub><sup>*T*</sup>; the subscript in ùîº<sub>*t*,‚ÄÜ*x*</sub> indicates that *X*<sub>*t*</sub>‚ÄÑ=‚ÄÑ*x*; *V* is called the value function; and *G* is called the payoff or gain function.

The goal here is to find the best strategy (the stopping time that maximazes the mean payoff) *œÑ*<sup>\*</sup>(*t*,‚ÄÜ*x*) and the value function *V*(*t*,‚ÄÜ*x*)=ùîº<sub>*t*,‚ÄÜ*x*</sub>\[*G*(*X*<sub>*t*‚ÄÖ+‚ÄÖ*œÑ*<sup>\*</sup>(*t*,‚ÄÜ*x*)</sub>)\]

Ussualy, *œÑ*<sup>\*</sup>(*t*,‚ÄÜ*x*) can be caracterized by means of the boundary between the so-called stopping set (i.e., the closed set $\\bar{D} = \\{(t,x)\\in \[0,T\]\\times\\mathbb{R}\_{+} : V(t,x) = G(x)\\}$) and its complement, the so-called continuation set (i.e., the open set *C*‚ÄÑ=‚ÄÑ{(*t*,‚ÄÜ*x*)‚àà\[0,‚ÄÜ*T*\]√ó‚Ñù<sub>+</sub>‚ÄÑ:‚ÄÑ*V*(*t*,‚ÄÜ*x*)&lt;*G*(*x*)})

A common method to solve the optimal stopping problem () is by reformulating it into a free-boundary problem whose solution is both the value function and the boundary.

To know more about optimal stopping problems and, specifically, about the free-boundary technique, one can chek out the book (Peskir and Shiryaev 2006).

Our problem
===========

We took *G* as the identity and (*X*<sub>*s*</sub>)<sub>*s*‚ÄÑ=‚ÄÑ0</sub><sup>*T*</sup> as a Brownian bridge ending up in some point *y*‚ÄÑ‚àà‚ÄÑ‚Ñù and endowed with an unknown volatility *œÉ*. Under these settings there exists a continuous non-increasing function *b*‚ÄÑ:‚ÄÑ\[0,‚ÄÜ*T*\]‚Üí‚Ñù such that *b*(*t*)&gt;*y* for all *t*‚ÄÑ‚àà‚ÄÑ\[0,‚ÄÜ*T*) and *b*(*T*)=*y*, playing the role of the boundary between the stopping set and the continuation set, and characterizing the optimal stopping time as follows \[preprint bla bla\]:

This is the repository companion of the preprint \[bla bla\], and it is intended to provide the users a set of tools for inferring and computing the boundary *b* based on a value of the volatility *œÉ*, which can be given in advance or estimated from the evolution of the stochastic process (*X*<sub>*s*</sub>)<sub>*s*‚ÄÑ=‚ÄÑ0</sub><sup>*T*</sup>.

In order to achieve that goal we broke down the code in four main block.

Simulation
==========

This block is devoted to generate the data (Brownian bridges) the user might need to performe simulation studies to test (out) the results comming from the tools given at the computing and inferring blocks

### Description

### Description

Simulates Brownian bridges forced to stop by a given point.

### Usage

### Arguments

-    - number of Brownian bridges to be generated
-    - initial value *X*<sub>0</sub> =
-    - ordinate of the point where the process has to stop by
-    - final value *X*<sub>`T`</sub> =
-    - volatility of the process
-    - horizon
-    - number of equal spaced subintervals in which the interval \[0,‚ÄÜ`T`\] will be split
-    - discretization of the interval \[0,‚ÄÜ`T`\]
-    - number of the element of that will be the abscissa of the point where the procees has to stop by
-    - matrix whose rows are multivariate vectors of independent normal random variables with size

### Details

 simulates Brownian bridges from *X*<sub>0</sub>‚ÄÑ=‚ÄÑ`a` to *X*<sub>`T`</sub>‚ÄÑ=‚ÄÑ`y`, such that *X*<sub>`t`<sub>`N1`</sub></sub>‚ÄÑ=‚ÄÑ`c`, based on a Brownian motion with volatility, and discretized at the points given by . If is not given it assumes the equally spaced discretization made of subintervals.

 is a matrix with rows and - 2 columns, such that each row is a multivariate normal vector with the identity as the covariance matrix. It is used to generate the Brownian bridge's paths by adjusting the covariance matrix and the mean of each row. The reason it has only - 2 columns is because it is known the paths will fit the points (`t`<sub>`N1`</sub>,‚ÄÜ`c`) and (`T`,‚ÄÜ`b`). can be useful when using a fixed seed, for example: *m*‚ÄÖ+‚ÄÖ1 and *m* samples would have the first *m* samples in common; changing would output quite similar paths. If is not given, it is randomly generated.

### Value

A matrix with rows and columns, such that each row is a Brownian bridge's path discretized at the points indicated in and forced to pass through (*t*<sub>*N*1</sub>,‚ÄÜ*b*)

### Example

``` r
set.seed(91)
BBs <- rBBB(n = 5, b = 2, N1 = 100, N = 200)
matplot(seq(0, 1, by = 1/200), t(BBs), type = "l", 
        lty = 1, lwd = 1, bty="n", yaxt='n', ylab = "",

Computing the boundary
----------------------

This entire project relies on having a fairly good numerical computation of the optimal stopping boundary when there is not even uncertainity, i.e., the value of *œÉ* is known. This is what this section stands for, which only function implements Algorithm 1 from the preprint \[bla bla\]. It was developed using the package Rcpp in R, which allows the integration of R and . This was done mainly for the sake of speed in simulation studies, which could take too much time if the boundary computation had a bad timing

### Description

Inference
---------

This section holds two functions that tackle, respectively, the two task that involve inference, which are, roughly: to estimate the volatility of a Brownian bridge, and make that estimation extensible to the boundary.

### Description

Estimates the volatility of a Brownian bridge using the maximum likelihood method

### Usage

### Arguments

-    - a matrix whose rows are Brownian bridge's paths, not necessarily with the same volatility
-    - an index between 1 and  - 1
-    - horizon
-    - discretization of the interval \[0,‚ÄÜ`T`\] where the Brownian bridges were sampled

### Details

 takes the first values of each one of the discretized Brownian bridges given at and computes the maximum likelihood estimator for their volatilities. If is not given, will use the equally spaced discretization made of subintervals.

### Value

A vector whose i-th entry is the volatility estimated for the Brownian bridge at the i-th row of

### Example

``` r
# libraries
library(mvtnorm)
library(latex2exp)

set.seed(43)

# generating the Brownian briges samples
samp <- rBB(n = 5, N = 200)

# computing the volatilities
Sigma <- sapply(2:200, function(x) SigMl(samp = samp, N1 = x))

# plot
matplot(1:199, t(Sigma), type = "l", lty = 1, lwd = 1.5, col = "blue",
        xlab = TeX("$k$"), ylab = "", bty="n", yaxt = "n", xaxt = "n")
lines(1:199, rep(1, 199), lty = 2, lwd = 3, col = "red")
axis(1, at = c(0, 100, 200), labels = c("0", "100", "200"), padj = 0)
axis(2, at = c(0.25, 1, 3), labels = c("", "1", "3"), padj = 0)
legend("topright", legend = c(TeX("$\\widehat{\\sigma}_{k}$"), TeX("$\\sigma = 1$")), 
       lty = c(1, 2), lwd = c(1.5, 2), col = c("blue", "red"), bty = "n", cex = 1.6)
```

### Usage

### Arguments

-    - increment in the incremental ratio

### Details

For each , such that 1 ‚â§ ‚â§ and 1 ‚â§ ‚â§ , generates values of the payoff derived as follows:

-   simulate Brownian bridges via and force then to stop by (`t[i]`,‚ÄÜ*X*<sub>`t[i]`</sub><sup>`q[j]`</sup>), where *X*<sub>`t[i]`</sub><sup>`q[j]`</sup>) is the percentile of the marginal distribution of the process at time \[i\],
-   use the paths of the Brownian bridges, from *X*<sub>`t[1]`</sub> until *X*<sub>`t[i]`</sub> to estimate a vector of volatilities of the process
-   compute boundaries associated to the estimated volatilities using the function
-   compute the pairs of confidence curves associated to the boundaries
-   look at the paths of the Brownian bridges, from *X*<sub>`t[j]`</sub> until *X*<sub>`T`</sub> and pick the first value that lies above the numerical computed boundary, the two confidence functions, and the true optimal stopping boundary

### Value
