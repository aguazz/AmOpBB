# Optimal stopping time for a Brownian Bridge

## Forewords

This software is meant to support the unpublished paper (cite). Its ultimately purpose is:

1. To compute the optimal boundary of the optimal stopping problem that considers a Brownian bridge with some volatility as the underling process, and the identity as the gain function.
2.

to compute the optimal stopping boundary for a Brownian bridge as the underlying process and the identity as the gain function.
