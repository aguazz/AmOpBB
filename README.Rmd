# Optimal stopping time for a Brownian Bridge

## Forewords

This repository is meant to support the unpublished paper (cite). Its ultimately purpose is:

1. To compute the optimal boundary of the optimal stopping problem that considers a Brownian bridge with some volatility as the underling process, and the identity as the gain function.
2. To estimate the volatility of the Brownian bridge based on its evolution, and the use that estimation to build point-wise confidence function for the optimal boundary.

Alongside, for the sake of reproducibility, we provide the simulation tools used in (cite) to carry out its propoused simulation study
